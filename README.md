# EventStoreDB .NET Client

EventStoreDB is the open-source, functional database with Complex Event Processing in JavaScript.

This is the repository for the .NET client for EventStoreDB version 20+ and uses gRPC as the communication protocol.
If you're looking for the TCP client library (legacy), check the [EventStoreDB repository v5 branch](https://github.com/EventStore/EventStore/tree/v5-master).
